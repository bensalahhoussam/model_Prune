## Model Pruning with Taylor Ranking
This repository provides an implementation of structured model pruning using the Taylor expansion based ranking criterion. The technique evaluates the importance of model channels/filters by estimating the change in loss when each channel is removed, using a first-order Taylor expansion.

ðŸš€ Key Features
Taylor Ranking for channel importance estimation

Support for structured pruning (e.g., filters, channels, layers)

Designed for CNN-based architectures (e.g., ResNet, ,Unet, VGG)

Compatible with PyTorch

Option to prune multiple layers and fine-tune the network afterward

ðŸ“˜ What is Taylor Pruning?
Taylor Pruning leverages the first-order Taylor expansion of the loss function to estimate how much the loss would increase if a particular parameter (e.g., filter or channel) is removed. The magnitude of this approximation serves as an importance score for pruning.

Mathematically:

Î”L â‰ˆ âˆ‚L/âˆ‚w Ã— w

The smaller the score, the less impact the weight/channel has on the loss â€” making it a candidate for pruning.

## Run 
This performs ranking, removal, finetuning and evaluation in one pruning iteration.  
```python prune.py --load YOUR_MODEL.pth --channel_txt YOUR_CHANNELS.txt```
